# Snake AI

![](https://github.com/foldupcircle/snake-ai/blob/main/snake-ai.gif)

## Key Features
* Implemented Reinforcement Learning with Pytorch
* Optimized model by adjusting state and learning rate
* Introduced obstacles to challenge the AI
* Added levels of difficulty and a test framework to test validity of model

## Testing the Model
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `python test.py` in your terminal inside the snake-ai folder
3. Select a level (1-5) with 1 being the easiest, 5 the hardest
4. Watch the AI try to play snake!

## Training the Model
To observe how the model is trained, you can run `python agent.py`

* This project is based on the snake AI course from freeCodeCamp, which can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8ypSXwyBds&t=1236s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org. After going through this course, I've made my own improvements to the project, including obstacles, levels, optimizing the model, and other features.
