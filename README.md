# Snake AI

## Key Features
* Implemented Reinforcement Learning with Pytorch
* Optimized model by adjusting state and learning rate
* Introduced obstacles to challenge the AI
* Added levels of difficulty and a test framework to test validity of model

## Testing the Model
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `python test.py` in your terminal inside the snake-ai folder
3. Select a level (1-5) with 1 being the easiest, 5 the hardest
4. Watch the AI try to play snake!

## Training the Model
To observe how the model is trained, you can run `python agent.py`
